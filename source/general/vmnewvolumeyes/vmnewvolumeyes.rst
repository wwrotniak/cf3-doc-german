If you choose "Image", you can choose the option "Create New Volume": Yes or No

By default the option "No" is chosen

**Option: Create New Volume - Yes**

This option allows you to choose the system volume different from that defined in the flavor

Now you can choose the Volume Size

In the example below we will choose the volume 15 GB and apply it to the flavor eo1.xsmall

Default size of the system disk for flavor eo1.xsmall is 8 GB
