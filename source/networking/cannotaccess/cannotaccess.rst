Cannot access VM with SSH or PING?
==================================

Before you contact the Support - please try to reboot your VM (soft or hard). Lack of contact could have been caused by the expired DHCP. Rebooting will allow to get fresh DHCP session and everything will work fine.

Assumption:
::

   You have to be convinced that your port 22 (SSH) is allowed in your 
   Access&Security group associated with your instance.
