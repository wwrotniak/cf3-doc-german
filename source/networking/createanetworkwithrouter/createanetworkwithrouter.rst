1. Log in to your OpenStack dashboard and choose **Network** tab, then choose **Networks** sub-label.

4. Define your Subnet name. Assign a valid network address with mask presented as a prefix. (This number determines how many bytes are being destined for network address)

Define Gateway IP for your Router. Normally it’s the first available address in the subnet.

Go to Next.
