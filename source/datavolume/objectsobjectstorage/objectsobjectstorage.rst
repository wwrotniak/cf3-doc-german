How many objects can I put into Object Storage container (bucket)?
==================================================================

.. note::
  It is highly advisable to put not more than 1 Mil (1 000 000) objects into one bucket (container).
  More objects makes listing of the objects very inefficient.
  We suggest to create many buckets with small amount of objects instead of small amount of buckets with many objects.
